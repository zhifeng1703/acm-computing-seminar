| 1 <2018-08-27 Mon> | 1. Read the Programming assignment resources carefully.                             |
|                    |                                                                                     |

| 3 <2018-09-10 Mon> | [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basel_problem][Basel problem]]                                                                       |
|                    | IMPORTANT: Do $S_N$ in single precision and $\frac{\pi^2}{6}$ in double precision.  |
| Assignment 1       | So that you have your $R_N = \frac{\pi^2}{6}-double(S_N)$ in double precision.      |
|                    |                                                                                     |
|                    | Basel problem asks for the precise summation of the infinite series:                |
|                    | $$\sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n^2}$$                                         |
|                    | The answer is known as $\frac{\pi^2}{6}$                                            |
|                    |                                                                                     |
|                    | Now, consider the truncated sum                                                     |
|                    | $$S_N=\sum\limits_{n=1}^{N} \frac{1}{n^2}$$                                         |
|                    | and the remainder term $R_N=\frac{\pi^2}{6}-S_N$. Derive a bound for $R_N$ of $N$   |
|                    |                                                                                     |
|                    | Write a code to compute $S_N,R_N$ with given $N$. Then pick 5 proper $N$ and run    |
|                    | it. Collect your result and do a logplot with $(N,R_N)$. Make comments on the       |
|                    | bound you derived and the result from your code:                                    |
|                    |                                                                                     |
|                    | Is it a tight bound?                                                                |
|                    | Any comment on the order of the bound(power of $N$)?                                |
|                    |                                                                                     |
|                    | Note: Feel free to use more than 5 $N$ if you can. For example, if you are          |
|                    | familiar with output to file process, you may run your code iteratively and output  |
|                    | all results to a file.                                                              |
|                    |                                                                                     |
|                    | You may use any software for plotting.                                              |
|                    |                                                                                     |
|                    | You may also plot your bound on the figure for illustration.                        |

| 4 <2018-09-17 Mon> | Follower problem                                                                    |
|                    |                                                                                     |
| Assignment 2       | In social networking sites like Facebook, users with follower relationship creates  |
|                    | a complicated oriented graph structure. Let $B\to A$ denotes $B$ follows $A$,       |
|                    | and suppose $C\to B$, $B\to A$, we call $C$ a sub-follower of $A$.                  |
|                    |                                                                                     |
|                    | Given all follower relationship of $N$ users in [[./resources/data/follower.txt][follower.txt]], write a code to       |
|                    | accomplish 2 tasks:                                                                 |
|                    |                                                                                     |
|                    | 1. Determined if a user $B$ is a follower or sub-follower (no need to distinguish), |
|                    | of a user $A$.                                                                      |
|                    | 2. For a given number $M$, counted how many users have followers and sub-followers  |
|                    | more than $M$.                                                                      |
|                    |                                                                                     |
|                    | These tasks should be done in function. You may store whole follower network and    |
|                    | work with raw data provide in the data. A better approach would be create your      |
|                    | own data structure storing the information you need for the tasks, some kind of     |
|                    | preprocessing of the raw data. Feel free to create your structure via =class=.      |
|                    |                                                                                     |
|                    | Data format:                                                                        |
|                    | The first integer represents the number of all users $N$. The following numbers     |
|                    | pair $A B$ represents user $A$ have followed $B$, $A\to B$. Example:                |
|                    |                                                                                     |
|                    | 3 1 2 2 1 2 3                                                                       |
|                    |                                                                                     |
|                    | This example means there are 3 users in total, user #1 and #2 follow each other     |
|                    | and user #2 have followed user #3                                                   |

| <2018-09-24 Mon>   | Duplicate the matrix class in the guide, add one more function =print= to it.       |
|                    |                                                                                     |
| Assignment 3       | this =print= will output the matrix to a file. You may open the file outside or     |
|                    | inside the function. In other words, for Fortran, you may only the file outside and |
|                    | pass the unit number of your file to the function or you can onpen the file inside  |
|                    | the function and close it when you exit, for C++, you may create the buffer         |
|                    | zone =ofstream= outside pass the reference or you may create the buffer zone inside |
|                    | the function. In practise open the file outside and pass the buffer zone is better. |
